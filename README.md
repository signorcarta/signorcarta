I am an Italian ICT Engineering student, currently completing an end of studies internship.

Alongside an Engineering mindset, I have a strong Computer Science and Mathematical background earned through my academic path. I am comfortable at working both in a team and alone, being a proactive and independent problem solver. Passionate about research, development and innovation, I'm willing to learn what needed to achieve success in everything I lend my efforts to. Fluent in English and open minded, I'm open to new challenges and different cultures.
